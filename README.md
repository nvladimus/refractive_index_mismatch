# Ray tracing of spherical aberration due to refractive index mismatch

Ray tracing from a point source inside a biological sample under a glass coverslip, with objective immersed in media with various refractive indices (air, water, glycerol, oil). The sample is assumed to be aqueous or mounted in highly refractive media (like ProLong Gold). The simulations show how spherical aberration depends on sample depth, refr.index of sample, and of immersion media.
