# Ray tracing and simulations for microscopy

1. Ray tracing from a point source inside an aqueous sample (like C.elegans or cell culture) under a glass coverslip, with objective immersed in media with various refractive indices (water, glycerol, oil). The simulations show how spherical aberration depends on sample depth and immersion media.
