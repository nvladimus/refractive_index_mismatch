Ray tracing and simulations for microscopy (high-NA optics)

Tracing of rays from point source in an aqeous media under a glass coverslip, with objective immersion media of various refractive index (water, glycerol, oil). The simulations show how spherical aberration depends on sample depth and immersion media.
